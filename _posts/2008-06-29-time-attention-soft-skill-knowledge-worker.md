In his talk, **Time and Attention**, [Merlin Mann](http://www.43folders.com/ "Merlin Mann of 43 Folders fame") talks about being conscious of what grabs your attention, negotiating requests for attention, and communicating organization culture around communication.

I enjoyed the part about defaults.Â  Simple tips for improving concentration:

  * Configure your email client to _not_ notify you when an email arrives.
  * Configure your instant messenger to _not_ notify you when anyone changes status.
  * Change your browser&#8217;s home page to be something simple, something that does not display recent news, quizzes, weather, traffic, recent emails in a personal email account, recent blog posts. I prefer the fastest-loading option: [about:blank](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/About:_URI_scheme#Common_about:_addresses), and I use Firefox&#8217;s built-in search.

I recently saw Merlin Mann speak at a [OmniFocus](http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnifocus/ "Professional-grade personal task management for Mac OS X") meeting hosted by [The Omni Group](http://www.omnigroup.com/ "The Omni Group develops productivity applications exclusively for Mac OS X").
