[Parleys.com](http://parleys.com "View talks from software conferences") publishes talks from software conferences.  I like seeing high-quality slides alongside video of the speaker.  [Paryleys&#8217; podcast](http://parleys.libsyn.com/rss "Parley's podcast RSS feed") is an audio only version of the talks you can watch on their site. Two of my favorite talks are:

  * [Flow of Change](http://www.parleys.com/display/V21Beta/Home#talk=1179649;slide=1;title=Flow%20of%20Change "by Tony Smith, European Technical Services Manager for Perforce Software") which discusses managing change in source control systems
  
    Speaker: Tony Smith, European Technical Services Manager for Perforce Software
  * [The Truck Driving Problem](http://www.parleys.com/display/V21Beta/Home#talk=4653075;slide=12;title=The%20Truck%20Driving%20Problem "by Mary Poppendieck author of Lean Software Development: An Agile Toolkit") which discusses developing innovation
