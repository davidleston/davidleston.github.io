In his talk, **Dynamics of real-world networks**, [Jure Leskovec](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jure/ "PhD candidate in the Machine Learning Department, School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University, undergraduate in  Computer Science at  University of Ljubljana, Slovenia") discusses where to place sensors in a network to detect cascades such virus outbreaks or rising memes.Â I particularly enjoyed Jure's explanation of how [the cost-effective lazy forward-selection algorithm](http://www.scribd.com/doc/424343/Costeffective-Outbreak-Detection-in-Networks "Cost-effective Outbreak Detection in Networks "), which his team developed, helps to balance the cost of the sensors versus the reward of early detection.
