Another podcast I listen to is [Software Engineering Radio](http://www.se-radio.net/ "Software Engineering Radio is a podcast targeted at the professional software developer").Â [The Debugging episode](http://www.se-radio.net/podcast/2008-06/episode-101-andreas-zeller-debugging "Andreas Zeller on Debugging") talks about how testing does not prevent the need to debug, that debugging is a search problem, and tools for estimating where source for bugs are located.
