I've received some requests to share some of my favorite podcasts. The first I'd like to share is a non-technical podcast called Big Ideas. It's the only regularly scheduled program dedicated to the art of the lecture and the importance of ideas in public life. One of my favorite Big Ideas lectures is by Oxford University's Harvey R. Brown. [This lecture is a fun ride on the logic train, discussing motion and time.](http://digg.com/podcasts/Big_Ideas/266255 "TVO Big Ideas: February 18 2007: Harvey Brown: Motion and Time") Enjoy.
