Recently, I've ran into a few interesting talks related to testing. In this first talk, [Steven Dow](http://www.stanford.edu/~spdow/) talks about some early studies on how prototyping has an effect on the performance of the end result. As you'll see in the Q&A, people are hungry to know more about how we can structure tests for our ideas.

Next, Michael Tamm presents <a href="http://code.google.com/p/fighting-layout-bugs/">"Fighting Layout Bugs", a library to detect layout bugs</a>. This is something that will save a lot of time and prevent many layout bugs by bringing an unprecedented level of automation to testing page rendering. This is something to keep an eye on.

Let's talk about [model-based testing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-based_testing). [Mark Utting](http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/~marku/) gives an introduction.

Then, [Atif Memon](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~atif/newsite/index.htm) discusses applying model-based testing to web applications.

Finally, [Darko Marinov](http://mir.cs.illinois.edu/~marinov/) talks about test selection when conducting model-based testing.
