I would like to see [design by contract](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_contract) become mainstream. [JSR-305](http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=305), **Annotations for Software Defect Detection**, is a step in the right direction. The applicability of this standard is broader than the name suggests. Here&#8217;s a talk about the JSR by Bill Pugh:

I would like to see compile-time and full IDE support for design by contact.
